# Cities-Productivity-and-High-Skilled-Workers-Segregation.
The goal of this investigation is to study, empirically, the effect of high-skilled workers-workers with a university degree-segregation on cities' labor productivity. Using data for USA Metropolitan Areas we find evidence of a positive impact. Exploring possible mechanisms, we find that clusters of high-skilled workers produce positive spillovers on high-skilled workers productivity that more than compensate for the low-skilled workers' productivity loss due to their exclusion. The latter is particularly valid in cities specialized in industries where the complementary between these two kinds of workers in the city production function is low, like technology or sciences. We use panel data and IV approach as identification strategy. Results are robust to different specifications.
